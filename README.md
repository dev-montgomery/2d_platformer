I began this project to learn how to create a 2D side scroller. 

The player is not my design, but I modified the spriteSheet for use in my project. The rest of the assets are mine. There weren't any free sprites I liked, so I quickly made assets for my own parallax background using Gimp.

I'm setting this project aside for now since it was just a learning exercise. There are things that I will attempt to address at a later time like screen responsiveness (currently works best in small screen sizes), redrawing assets to create a continuous flow, and proper character movement. I'd also like to address how it seems to eat resources the longer it runs.

There were things I did differently from Chris Courses tutorial. Perhaps as I learn more, I'll recognize his means was more best practices and more efficient.
